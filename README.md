# Moneyball part 1
Using statistics to help different sport organizations (NBA, NFL, NHL, etc) improve their team, write a program that has the following inputs:

Number of years of data for a particular player
Players starting year

The program should output the best (highest) year and the worst (lowest) year for the player.

# Moneyball part 2
Do the same thing as part 1 but the output should be the years from worst to best in sorted order
